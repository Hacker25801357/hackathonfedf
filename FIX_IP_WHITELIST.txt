FIX: IP ADDRESS WHITELIST ISSUE
========================================

Your MongoDB Atlas connection string is correct!
But your IP address needs to be allowed to connect.

FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1. Go to MongoDB Atlas: https://cloud.mongodb.com/

2. Log in with your account

3. Click on "Network Access" (left sidebar)
   - Under "Security" section
   - OR go to: https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/security/network/accessList

4. Click "ADD IP ADDRESS" button

5. Choose ONE option:

   OPTION A (Recommended for Development):
   ----------------------------------------
   - Click "ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE"
   - This will add: 0.0.0.0/0
   - Description: "Allow all IPs"
   - Click "Confirm"

   OPTION B (Your Current IP Only):
   ---------------------------------
   - Click "ADD CURRENT IP ADDRESS"
   - It will auto-detect your IP
   - Description: "My IP"
   - Click "Confirm"

6. Wait 1-2 minutes for the change to take effect

7. Your backend server will automatically reconnect!

========================================
AFTER ADDING IP ADDRESS:
========================================

You should see in your backend terminal:
✅ "MongoDB Connected: eduresourcehub-shard-00-00.2fkswz4.mongodb.net"

Then run:
cd C:\Users\rajes\hackathon\backend
npm run seed

This will populate your database with sample data!
